  <p>
    I am a MPhil student at The University of Hong Kong (HKU), supervised by <a href="https://hongyangdu.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Hongyang Du</a> at NICE Lab. Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's degree at the National University of Singapore (NUS) under the supervision of <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/" target="_blank">Prof. Bingsheng He</a>. My research interests lie in Agentic AI, specifically Agent+Data and RAG. I am open to collaborating with people who share similar research interests.
